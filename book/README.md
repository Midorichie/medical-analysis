# Medical Image Analysis using Deep Learning
## Stacks Blockchain Implementation

### Project Overview
This project implements a decentralized medical image analysis system using deep learning models and the Stacks blockchain. The system allows for secure storage and verification of medical image diagnoses while maintaining patient privacy through cryptographic hashing.

### Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contract Components
1. **Analysis Storage**
   - Secure storage of diagnosis results
   - Mapping of image hashes to analysis results
   - Confidence score tracking

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access management
   - Verified medical professional registration
   - Admin controls for system parameters

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Minimum confidence thresholds
   - Timestamp tracking
   - Analyst accountability

### Development Setup

1. Install Clarinet:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/download/v1.0.0/clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz
```

2. Initialize Project:
```bash
clarinet new medical-image-analysis
cd medical-image-analysis
```

3. Setup Dependencies:
```bash
clarinet contract new medical-analysis
```
